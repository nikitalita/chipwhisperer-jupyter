    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- [PA_HW_CW305_1-Attacking_AES_on_an_FPGA.ipynb](PA_HW_CW305_1-Attacking_AES_on_an_FPGA.ipynb) (run this first!)\n",

    "- CW305 or CW312 A35 target\n",
    "- CW-Lite, Pro, or Husky\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Our [\"normal\" hardware AES implementation](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/tree/develop/hardware/victims/cw305_artixtarget/fpga/vivado_examples/aes128_verilog) performs one round of AES in one clock cycle; the 10 rounds of AES-128 are done in 11 consecutive clock cycles (the +1 will be covered later). This is pretty fast! It means that 128 bits are encrypted in 11 cycles. At 100 MHz, this is 1.1 Gbps of encryption. For some applications -- think disk encryption, memory encryption, layer 2 or layer 3 encryption (MACsec/IPsec) -- this may not be fast enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some (but not all) [block cipher modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation) of AES can be pipelined: the idea is to replicate the round encryption for each round. So in the case of AES-128, imagine having 10 round modules; let's label these RM1 through RM10. In the first clock cycle, RM1 performs the first round of encryption on the first AES block. On the second clock cycle, the output of RM1 is fed to RM2, which performs the second round of encryption on the first AES block, **while at the same time** RM1 begins encrypting the second AES block. Once the pipeline is filled, ten different AES plaintext are at different stages of encryption, and a fully encrypted AES block is produced at each clock cycle. This boosts throughput by a factor of 11. Pipelining trades off area and power for throughput: a factor of X increase in throughput can be obtained at the cost of increasing area and power by X also. A block cipher mode can be pipelined if the encryption or decryption of a block does not depend on the result of the previous encryption or decryption; examples include CTR, XTS, and GCM. An example of a mode which cannot be pipelined is CBC.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Target\n",
    "[The target(s)](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/tree/develop/hardware/victims/cw305_artixtarget/fpga/vivado_examples/aes128_pipelined) for this demo were built quite straightforwardly by taking our [\"normal\" hardware AES implementation](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/tree/develop/hardware/victims/cw305_artixtarget/fpga/vivado_examples/aes128_verilog), instantiating multiple rounds, and tweaking the control logic to feed the rounds. The goal was to minimize modifications to the original design; this lets us quantify the effect of pipelining on side-channel attacks. We'll study 4 pipelined variants: one fully pipelined implementation, and one \"half-pipelined\" implementation done three different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "1. See that encrypting multiple AES rounds at the same time does not prevent CPA attacks.\n",
    "2. De-mystify leakage models by matching different leakage models to different implementations.\n",
    "3. As a bonus: see that Vivado can do unexpected things that have a huge impact on leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Platform Notes\n",
    "This notebook was developed with the CW305 target and CW-Husky. Other combinations are possible as per the requirements above, but results may differ slightly, and some tweaks will be required; these will be noted throughout (i.e. don't blindly run through the cells and expect it to work; follow the instructions and make any required modifications).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the CW312 A35 target, the gain is set at a proper setting for the inductive shunt. If you're using a different shunt, you may need to make adjustments.\n"
